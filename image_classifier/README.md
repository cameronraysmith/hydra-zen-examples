# Image Classification Example

This example demonstrates configuration of an image classification model using PyTorch Lightning.

## Configs

See `hydra_zen_examples/image_classification/configs.py` to see experiment configurations.

## Run Experiment

In the `experiment` directory run the following to train a ResNet-50 model on CIFAR-10:

```python
python run.py
```

See `Experiment.ipynb` for an example of running experiments in the notebook.
